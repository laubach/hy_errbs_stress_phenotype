============================

This repository is the parent directory for scripts and output for the analysis of spotted hyena eRRBS data.

All analysis is conducted in program R. R scripts and output are located in labeled subdirecties. Data are stored remotely until manuscripts have been published and made publicly available. 

Laboratory procedures are documented elsewhere.
